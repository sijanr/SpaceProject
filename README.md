# SpaceProject
It is a **java project** that takes the items from the **"phase-"** files provided, and stores the items in a collectible of one of the two rockets **U1** or **U2**. After storing the items, it runs the simulation to estimate the budget required for the number of rockets that would take all the items to space.

## Getting started
Load up the project in one of the java compatible IDEs, and compile and run the project that should by default contain the **"phase-"** files. You are free to change the items and their respective weights in **"phase-"** files to have the program estimate the budget with respect to the change.
**Note:** The weights of items in the **"phase-"** files have to be in **kilograms(kg)**.

**Prerequisites**
  - Java SE Development Kit
  - IDE that that runs and compiles Java projects (Eclipse, IntelliJ,..)
